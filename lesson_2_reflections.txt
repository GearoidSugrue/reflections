What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates hidden metadata files. These metadata files will be used to store commit history, changes made, etc

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermedery between the wd and res. It allows you to choose what files should be included in the commit.
This gives a lot of flexability.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can decide to add only the files related to the logical change to the staging area.
Then committing them before adding the files releated to the next logical change to the staging area and doing the same.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When making big changes, exprimentle features or ones that might break the code.
Branches act as labels and make it clear which features are a part of what as the commits are kept seperate.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They show the reachablity of each commit.
They are also useful for identifing where branches are in relation to each other
as well as the master branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The two branches are combined.
A new commit is created that contains info on both of its parents.
ie the latest commits of each branch.
This new commit becomes the new head and will contain all of the changes made from both branches.
Its represent like that in the diagram as we will still have access to all of their commits.
Commits are organised by timestamp.
