What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates hidden metadata files. These metadata files will be used to store commit history, changes made, etc

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermedery between the wd and res. It allows you to choose what files should be included in the commit.
This gives a lot of flexability.
