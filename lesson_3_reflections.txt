When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working from more than one computer or when working with someone else.
It also serves as a backup should anything happen to your computer or the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
As more than one person can be working on a respository there may be changes that cause conflicts.
If git pulled automatically it could cause problems and may even break the code.
Pulling manually allows you more flexablity.
