When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working from more than one computer or when working with someone else.
It also serves as a backup should anything happen to your computer or the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
As more than one person can be working on a respository there may be changes that cause conflicts.
If git pulled automatically it could cause problems and may even break the code.
Pulling manually allows you more flexablity.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Cloning copies the current state of the entire repository into another location. 
It can be used to copy the remote repositorys on GitHub into the local machine.
Or even from one local working directory into another.

Forking can only be done on GitHub. It copies an entire repository into your GitHub account.
The differce between cloining is that it still gives the original respository creator credit.
It also only takes the click of a button to fork.

Branches are often used when implementing new features or large changes or different functionality.
They are within the repository itself.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It makes it easy to see how many commits ahead you are 
but also how many commits behind the remote on GitHub you are.
It is very useful when your going offline for awhile as it can update the local copy.
This can be done without merging, so you dont have to merge until your ready.
